	<h3>Hi. My Name is Damon, and here you will find all of my front end web development 
	projects that I have been working on just for fun, or to serve a purpose.<br>
	Each one of these projects shows my skills in Web Design, HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h3>
	<h3>Check out my latest projects, both finished and in progress</h3>

		<h3>Javascript percentage calculator</h3>
		<p>I simply made this because I frequently need to figure out different percentage calculations based on
		what I'm doing in regards to the stock market, profit margins for my busisness, or simply just to find a
		random calculation I want to know. There are sites/ calculators that exist already, but I just wanted to 
		make myself one, in the design that I like.</p>
